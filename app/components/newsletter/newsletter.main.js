            This conference is a not-for-profit community event run by a team
            of volunteers from the Cluj Javascripters community. 2017 is the
            first year when this amazing conference is taking place. It’s one
            of our dreams and the highpoint of our active community. We’re a
            bit crazy but at the end of the day, it’s all worth it :)

            in Cluj-Napoca. It is a one-track conference and we have rented the
            space from the hotel's ground floor, where there’s a spacious
            conference room and a large hallway and you can enjoy the technical
            booths and the conference registration.

          <h6>Travel...  ✈️🚆🚗</h6>
          <p>
            If you're joining us from around Europe, your easiest option to get
            here fast is a WizzAir connection.
          </p>
          <p>
            This also applies for travelling from within the country - Iasi.
            If you're from Bucharest, we recommend you take BlueAir - so that
            your seat will actually have some space for your legs. If you're
            joining from Timisoara or Budapest, the train is a comfortable
            (but quite expensive) option, but you can also drive here.
          </p>
          <p>
            For travelling inside Cluj-Napoca, we definitely recommend

            If you want to be 'adopted' by one of our Cluj JavaScripters during
            the JSHeroes conference (at least from Wednesday afternoon to
            Saturday morning, but possible more days if you wish to visit
            Cluj-Napoca), you can use our "Adopt a JavaScripter" couch-surfing
            program. We will pair you up with a host that we think is ok for
            you, according to the info you filled in the application forms.

            We also recommend finding an apartment through Airbnb or look for a
            hostel  - but hurry, it's the Transilvania International Film
            Festival time and the accommodation can be harder to find, than
            usual. And

          <p>
            JSHeroes unites top international speakers from
            🇩🇰 🇺🇸 🇷🇴 🇮🇱 🇮🇳 🇨🇭 🇭🇺 🇫🇷 🇳🇴 Throughout the two
            days of conference, they will talk about the latest trends in the
            world of JavaScript and Web Development. We have designed an agenda
            that is well balanced and targets the entire audience, including
            the people with extensive knowledge and experience.

            We are committed to tackle diverse topics and flavors from the

            complete analysis.

            All talks are in English. We have no live streaming of the talks.

          <br />
          <h6>Catering 🍲</h6>
          <p>
            There is premium catering lunch on both days (vegan options
            available) and coffee breaks. We definitely don't want you to run
            around all hungry and decaffeinated, throughout the day, so the
            lunch and coffee breaks are included in the ticket price. For
            lunch, you can expect a healthy meal with various options.
            It includes vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options.
          </p>
